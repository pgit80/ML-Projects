# ML-Projects
A repository where I store my every Machine Learning project

1. global_logistics.py is the file which solves the `Vehicle Routing Problem` of logistics and delivery related companies. I've used Genetic Algorithm concept to tackle the problem. I've used Python's Deap library which supports many other machine learning approached along with GAs.

2. maze_solver.py is the python code to solving the maze problem using Genetic Algorithms. It was the proior problem which I solved to get knowledge about the Genetic Algorithms and how to use python to implement this.
